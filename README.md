# Backend Development Practice Projects

Welcome to my backend practice repository! This collection of projects serves as a log of my journey into backend development. The main goal is to tackle various challenges to learn and solidify my understanding of different backend concepts, tools, and languages.

Most of the project ideas are sourced from the excellent [Backend Developer roadmap on roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend).

## Completed Projects

Here are the projects I have completed so far. Each project is contained within its own directory.

| Project Name            | Description                                                                          | Tech Stack | Project Requirement                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `task_tracker/`         | A command-line or API-based application to manage tasks (create, update, delete, list). |   Python   | [View Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)                 |
| `github_user_activity/` | A tool that fetches and displays recent activity for a given GitHub user.            |   Python   | [View Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity)         |
| `expense_tracker/`      | An application to track income and expenses, categorize them, and view summaries.    |   Python   | [View Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker)              |

## Tech Stack

My focus is on building a strong foundation in backend technologies. While the initial projects are built with Python, I plan to explore other languages and frameworks in the future.

## How to Run

Each project is self-contained in its respective directory. To run a specific project, please navigate to its folder and follow the instructions in its dedicated `README.md` file (if available) or check for dependency files like `requirements.txt` for Python projects.
