# Number Guessing Game

A classic "guess the number" game built in Python that runs in the command line. The script thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it within a limited number of chances.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 (No external libraries needed)

---

## Setup
Make sure flag.txt is in the same directory as the source code file. 

## How to Play

1. **Run the script from your terminal:**
```bash
python3 number_guess.py
```
2. **Choose a difficulty** by entering a number from 1 to 4.

3. **Start guessing!** Enter a number when prompted.

4. **Follow the hints** until you guess the number or run out of chances.

5. After the round is over, you will be asked if you want to **play again**.
